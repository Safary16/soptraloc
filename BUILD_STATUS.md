# üî® Build Status - Native Android App Compilation

## Current Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è BLOCKED - Network Restriction

### What Was Attempted:

1. ‚úÖ **Environment Setup**
   - Java 17 installed and configured
   - Node.js 20 installed
   - Android SDK available at `/usr/local/lib/android/sdk`
   - NPM dependencies installed successfully (954 packages)

2. ‚úÖ **Project Structure Created**
   - Created missing Java source files:
     - `MainActivity.java` - Main activity for React Native app
     - `MainApplication.java` - Application entry point
   - Created debug keystore for signing
   - Fixed Gradle wrapper configuration
   - Set up local.properties with SDK path

3. ‚ùå **Build Blocked by Network Restriction**
   - **Problem**: Gradle requires access to `dl.google.com` to download:
     - Android Gradle Plugin (7.4.2)
     - Android Browser Helper library (for TWA)
     - React Native Gradle Plugin dependencies
   - **Error**: `dl.google.com: No address associated with hostname`
   - **Impact**: Cannot compile APK without these dependencies

### Technical Details:

#### Attempted Build Commands:
```bash
# React Native App (mobile-app/android)
cd mobile-app/android && ./gradlew assembleDebug

# TWA App (android/)
cd android && ./gradlew assembleDebug
```

#### Both Failed With:
```
Could not GET 'https://dl.google.com/dl/android/maven2/...'
> dl.google.com: No address associated with hostname
```

### What's Needed:

**Option 1: Network Access (RECOMMENDED)**
- Need access to `dl.google.com` domain
- This is Google's Maven repository, essential for Android builds
- Once unblocked, the build should complete in 2-5 minutes

**Option 2: Alternative Approaches (Complex)**
- Pre-download all required dependencies manually
- Configure Gradle to use local Maven repository
- Estimated additional time: 2-4 hours

### Recommendation:

üéØ **REQUEST ACCESS TO `dl.google.com`**

This domain hosts:
- Android SDK components
- Google Play Services libraries  
- Android Gradle Plugin
- Android Browser Helper (for TWA)

Without it, **ANY** Android app compilation is impossible using standard Gradle build tools.

### Next Steps Once Unblocked:

1. **Compile Debug APK** (2-3 minutes)
   ```bash
   cd /home/runner/work/soptraloc/soptraloc/android
   ./gradlew assembleDebug
   ```

2. **APK Output Location**:
   ```
   android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
   ```

3. **Create Download Page** for drivers
4. **Test APK Installation** instructions

### Alternative: Use React Native App (If TWA Limitations Persist)

The React Native app in `mobile-app/` is more powerful but also requires `dl.google.com` access for:
- React Native dependencies
- Native module compilation
- Hermes JavaScript engine

**Status**: ‚è∏Ô∏è PAUSED - Waiting for network access  
**Blocker**: `dl.google.com` domain access required  
**Priority**: üî¥ HIGH - Cannot proceed without this  
**Estimated Time After Unblock**: 5-10 minutes to build  
**Date**: 2025-10-14  
**Agent**: GitHub Copilot
